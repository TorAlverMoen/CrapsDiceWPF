Rules for the First Turn:
* If you roll a 7 or 11, you win.
* If you roll a 2 (Snake Eyes), 3, or 12, you lose.
* All other rolls will be added to your points, and you will continue to the next round.

Rules for All Subsequent Turns:
* If you roll the same sum as the previous round, you win.
* If you roll a 7, you lose.
* All other rolls will be added to your points, and you will continue to the next round.
